# Valentine's Proposal Website ❤️

A unique, interactive proposal website featuring a runaway "No" button, a sentimental lock screen, and a timeline of your relationship.

## 🛠️ How to Customize

Before deploying, make sure to add your personal touch!

1.  **Photos**:
    *   Create an `assets` folder in this directory.
    *   Add your favorite photos (e.g., `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`).
    *   Open `index.html` and uncomment the `<img>` tags in the timeline section, replacing the `src` with your file names.

2.  **Memories**:
    *   Open `index.html`.
    *   Find the "Our Journey" section.
    *   Change the dates and descriptions to match your relationship milestones.

3.  **Passcode**:
    *   The current passcode is set to `26112022`.
    *   If you want to change it, open `script.js` and find the `SECRET_CODE` variable.
